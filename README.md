# Earthquake-Magnitude-Prediction-from-USGS-Questionnaire-Responses
This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the data from USGS's "Did You Feel It" (DYFI) Repository for all earthquakes in the contiguous United States and northern  Mexico of magnitude 4.0 or larger over the past year. Each data entry includes a listing of the number of people who reported feeling the motion to USGS in a  specific town or jurisdiction, the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) of the  motion at the specified location calculated from the questionnaire responses, the longitude and latitude of the  jurisdiction, as well as the distance to the epicenter of the earthquake and  its magnitude. The purpose of this project is to see if an earthquake's  magnitude (usually Moment Magnitude, Mw) at a given site can be predicted from the calculated intensity estimated from DYFI surveys submitted to USGS as well as the location of the respondents and distance from the epicenter. Being able to estimate  the moment magnitude from crowd-sourced responses would be helpful in areas where  seismic instrumentation is sparse and obtaining the earthquake magnitude quickly is difficult. The data was procured from this website for all earthquakes occurring  in the contiguous United States with magnitudes of 4.0 or greater between 7/4/2017 and 7/3/2018: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/dyfi/  A description of the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale can be found here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/mercalli.php
